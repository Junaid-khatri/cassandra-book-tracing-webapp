<p>Here i have alson include the Oauth2.0 google for login</p>
<p>The pom.xml file is taken from datastax website for cnnect cassandra database</p>
<p>By Default without including those dependancy i am not able to connect database nodes</p>
<p>Test file included in this repository is used for saving data to database</p>
<p>As we know the development of search function is very complicate in no-sql databases, so i have used open-ilibrary api's for implementing seach functionality.</p>
